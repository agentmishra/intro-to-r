# Mutate()
# you can use a variety of operators like multiplication:
gig_time %>% mutate(total = h * rate)

# also use +, -, /, ^, sum(), mean(), %/% (integer division), %% (remainder), 
# log(), lead(), lag(), cumsum (cumulative sum), cumprod(), cummax, cummin, 
# cummean(), logical comparisons, ranking: min_rank()


# to keep just the new column(s) use transmute
gig_time %>% transmute(total = h * rate)


# summarize()
gig_time %>% summarize(average_rate = mean(rate))
# really useful when we pair it with group_by()

gig_time %>% group_by(rate) %>% summarize(average_time = mean(h))

# if your dataset includes a bunch of missing values, you will need to use: 
# na.rm = TRUE

# grouped mutates
