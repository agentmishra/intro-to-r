# Step 2: Form your question(s)

# 1. Is there a significant difference between the number of pickups between any of
# the days of the week?

# 2. Is there a significant difference between any hour of the day? 

# What are some other questions that you might be able to ask about this dataset? 

# Does the weather (rain/sun) effect the number of pickups? 
# Are there areas with significantly higher numbers of pickups during the day? 
# Are certain areas more popular for pickups at different times of the day/week/month?
# Are there any cycles in the data?
